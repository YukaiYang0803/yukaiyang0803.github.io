<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi there! I am Yukai Yang, a 2nd year Master student in Statistics at UChicago.

I recently work on scientific machine learning, with a specific interest in AI4Bio. Previously, I have worked on Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models, fortunately advised by [Tim Rudner](https://timrudner.com/) and [Marco Morucci](https://marcomorucci.com/bio/). I also conducted research in AI Safety for Multi-agent System with Professor [Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/index.html)'s lab at UCLA. Prior to UChicago, I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree (magna cum laude) in Data Science and Mathematics from New York University. 
<!-- My research interest lies in **applying statistical tools to understand foundation models**, with a focus on high-dimensional statistics and random matrix theory. -->

<!-- During the time, I was fortunate to work with [Tim Rudner](https://timrudner.com/) and [Marco Morucci](https://marcomorucci.com/bio/) on active learning at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). -->

<!-- Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, badminton, and watching films. -->

I am applying for a PhD in AI/ML starting in 2026. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research!
